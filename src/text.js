My love,


Thank you for a memorable first date and for being so open and easy about our first feelings of excitement about each other.


For our second date and putting up with all my walls. For witnessing me laughing way too fucking loud in the movies during our third date.


For keeping up with our chatting while I was away for 3 weeks and making me feel so goddamn understood when you shared your writings for the first time with me.


Thank you for being there in the airport waiting for me and taking me home.


For loving me on my Hunchback of Notre Dame phase and for showing up when I got sick and missed Devin's concert.


For another memorable night on your birthday, the day I knew I was officially cursed with being obsessed with you.


For letting me witness your dancing skills during your lovely blasphemic birthday party.


For our first trip together to Hamburg and for the songs and stories you shared with me.


For joining my Eurovision stupidity and seeing our first concert kind of together.


Thanks for celebrating Pride with me, for visiting Bonaparte together for a last time and letting me make you feel as wanted and desired as you make me feel.


For joining me and my friends for a walk in the forests of Luxemburg.


For all the many conversations we had and for being a good listener. For helping me heal a bit more and dream.


For introducing me to dear Sarah, your lovely friends and your traditions.


For joining me and my friends in our Brazilians festivities and traditions.


Thank you for sharing the memories of the trip to Skye with me.


For the company during the long walks, for daring when I couldn't. For dancing with me after a long trail.


For the long hours looking at the beautiful moving skye and making me feel so immensely loved.


For all the Dutch practice.


For joining my silly birthday celebrations and for making me breakfast during my day.


For dressing up on Halloween together and for dancing and laughing to The Darkness. For dancing drunk in my living room to Voyager.


For introducing me to throwing myself into a wall and risk my ankles, all for having a good butt like yours.


Thank you for being in my life during this past year and making it so special.


Love is infinite, but this good of a love is rare. And I feel very lucky for every time I could find it in the eyes and actions of someone special like you.


I can only but hope that our years will be plenty and that we'll keep on caring for making them this special for each other and the ones we love.


Te amo,
La√≠s
